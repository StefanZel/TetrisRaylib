I've decided to complete this small project for the sake of improving my C++ and OOP skills before delving deeper into the Unreal Engine.

My original idea was to directly go to the Unreal Engine and start working on projects I wanted to make for quite some time. However, I quickly noticed how overwhelming that would be. 
So, i started small and made this interesting tetris game. The whole process was fun and helpful, and let's add that it was a nice warmup for the project I'm about to make!
